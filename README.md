# Compiler-Design-Lab
This repository contains problems from **Compiler Design Lab**.  
Each Lab has a doc in it, a self explanatory report of format:  
1. Aim  
2. Procedure/Explanation  
3. Code  
4. Input/Output Screen shot   
5. Inference  
And the lex code file is also uploaded seperately.  
  
**LAB-1**  
  
**1a :**

input  : a string  
output : valid/invalid  
**1b :**

**LAB-4**  
  
**4a :**

Input  : String of 0 and 1  
Output : Accepted/Not accepted  
**4b :**  
Write a program for the lex/flex scanner generator to construct a DFA which accepts the language in which all strings have an even number of 1’s and even number of 0's over inputs ‘0’ and ‘1’.  
Input  : String of 0 and 1  
Output : Accepted/Not accepted  
  
**LAB-5**  
  
**5a :**
